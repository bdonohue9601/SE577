Computer Architecture Course Project Week 1

My name is Brad Donohue and I am in the M.S. for Software Engineering program at Drexel. After taking this course I would like to have a good feel on how to plan and complete large software projects. Frontend development is more of a weak point for me so I am excited to have more of an opportunity to work on it and get more familiar with github.
